      "description": " I'm Keelen Fisher, a full time student for Code Fellow's Software Developmental program. I studies Computer Science ad the University of Houston Clear Lake, and I decided that I wanted to branch out an learn more about Full Stack Development. This career field truly excites me, from concepts of building virtual machines to applying problem solving skill like you never have before. It is all remarkable. I wante to see what part of Computer Science can provide me with good ambition and never-ending developmental possibilities. I would love to be a part of start up companies that provide a healthy and inviting environment, then soon join large corporations and assist in big changes across the country then the world. Take a look around my world, or in other words my website and enjoy! Thank you ü§ü",
